# known issues

	1. get_batch will always index error sequence


# TODO priority queue:
	1. REDO todo list !!

	1. Train on objects of the same class and apply to unseen ones of same class
		+ it is unclear if this will work

	2. infinite tester

	3. DOCUMENTATION!!!


# Other todos lol

	1. build NODE classification demo!!!

	2. write validation nets for testing against NODEs

		+ train/test splits on train set, since there are no labels on the test set.

		+ chunk by passband to classify each object by individual band

	3. documented jupyter notebook for presenting

	4. fix pd.merge memory inefficiency with onsite concat

	5. base index on 'mjd' column (time series indexing)


# Things that seem interesting but later:

	1. tf.distribute

	2. Gen and FluxDiffeq in Julia lang
