# TODO priority queue:
	1. build NODE classification demo!!!

	2. write validation nets for testing against NODEs

		+ train/test splits on train set, since there are no labels on the test set.

	3. documented jupyter notebook for presenting

	4. fix pd.merge memory inefficiency with onsite concat

	5. base index on 'mjd' column (time series indexing)
