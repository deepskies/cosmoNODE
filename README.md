Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Astronomical Sky Surveys

I am using the Kaggle PLAsTiCC-2018 dataset found here:
	+ https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018/

The goal is to see if there is any improvement in the classification accuracy using NODEs.

Given that ODEs are commonly used for time series analysis,
my hypothesis is that there will be a measurable improvement.
